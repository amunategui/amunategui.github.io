<p>Imagine a scenario unraveling at a chemical factory right after an explosion that
caused a dangerous chemical leak. The alarms are blazing and the personnel is evacuated 
as the leak cannot be located. They send an
autonomous robot inside the empty factory equipped with a camera, lights, and
environmental sensors, capable of capturing ambient humidity, in hopes of
locating the chemical leak.
</p>
<BR>
<p>The
robot has the ability to travel quickly and at ease through each room of the
factory without any prior knowledge of the layout. Its primary goal is to find
the shortest path to the leak by exploring each room and using its humidity
sensor and camera. The robot’s decision-making framework uses reinforcement
learning and will start traveling at random throughout the factory floor many
times, recording each path taken in detail to eventually determine the shortest
route to the leak. The goal isn’t only to find the leak but also to find the
shortest path. This will be of tremendous help to the emergency crew to quickly
locate the danger and limit human exposure to chemicals.</p>
<BR>

<p>As
Q-Learning requires constant back-and-forth and trial-and-error towards finding
a shortest path, why not make use of that discovery process to record as much
environmental data as possible? With the rise in popularity of Internet of
Things (IoT), there are plenty of third-party sensor attachments, hardware and
software management tools to leverage. This could be as simple as attaching a
temperature-sensing gauge on the bot with built-in data storage or realtime
transmission capabilities. The hope is to analyze the data after each incident
and learn more than simply the shortest path.</p>
<BR>

<p>We
then extend this scenario to another factory facing a similar chemical-leak
situation. This time the software in the bot is enhanced with an additional
system to leverage the IoT lessons learned from the first experience. The bot
won’t only look for the shortest path to the leak but will also use
environmental lessons it learned from the first incident.</p>
<BR>

<p>Let’s
see how the process of search and discovery can be enhanced when combining
Reinforcement Learning (RL), Machine Learning (ML), Internet of Things (IoT),
and Case-based reasoning (CBR).</p>
<BR>

<p><i><b>Note:</b> For a gentle introduction to RL and Q-Learning in Python, see a post I made on
my Github blog <a

<p><h1>Finding the Factory Floor with the Dangerous
Chemical Leak</h1></p>
<BR>

<p>The
goal in this experiment is to apply Q-Learning method to map the shortest path
to a chemical leak for response team. The factory floor plan considered for
this experiment comprises 57 rooms in which the entrance and the goal are
considered at room 0 and 50 respectively (see Figure 1).</p>
<BR>
<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="img/image002.png" width='50%' height='50%' alt="Image">
<BR>
Figure 1: Shows the graph representation of our chemical
factory. Each colored circle is a room. The entrance to the factory is room ‘0’
and the room with the chemical leak is room ‘50’.
</p>
<BR>

<p>Q-Learning
is an unsupervised learning process that will iterate thousands of times to map
and learn the fastest route to a goal point –room ‘50’ in our case. The bot
learns using an intelligent rewards-feedback mechanism. This is done with the
help of a rewards table, a large matrix used to score each path the bot can
follow. This is the matrix version of a road map. We initialize the matrix to
be the height and width of all our points (64 in this example) and initialize
all values to –1. We then change the viable paths to value 0 and goal paths to
100 (you can make the goal score anything you want as long as its larger enough
to propagate during Q-Learning).</p>
<BR>

<p>When
the model starts, it creates a blank Q-matrix (hence the name Q-Learning),
which is a matrix the same size as the rewards <span class=GramE>matrix</span>
but all values are initialized to 0. It is this Q-matrix that our model will
use to keep track and score how well the paths are doing. Each attempt is
scored using the following formula:</p>
<BR>

<BR>
<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="img/image003.png" width='50%' height='50%' alt="Image">
</p>
<BR>

<p>Equation (1) returns a score evaluating the move from one point to a new one. It also
takes in consideration any previous scores the model has already seen. The term
‘<i>state</i>’ is the current room the bot is in, and ‘action’ is the next
state or next room. is a tunable variable between 0 and 1 where values closer
to 0 make the model choose an immediate reward while values closer to 1 will
consider alternative paths and allow rewards from later moves. Finally, it
multiplies gamma against all experienced next actions from the Q-matrix. This
is an important part as all new actions take in consideration previous lessons
learned.</p>
<BR>

<p>To
understand how this works, let’s take a slight detour, and imagine that our
factory has only 5 rooms as shown in the Figure 2:</p>
<BR>

<BR>
<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="img/image004.png" width='50%' height='50%' alt="Image">
<BR>
Figure 2: All paths are initialized to 0 except for paths
leading to the goal point which is set to 100 (room 2 to room 4 and recursively
room 4 to room 2).</p>
<BR>

<p>Below
is the matrix format of the rewards table (-1s are used to fill non-existing
paths which the bot will ignore):</p>
<BR>

<BR>
<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="img/image005.png" width='50%' height='50%' alt="Image">
<BR>
Figure 3: Reward matrix with path and goal-point scores.</p>
<BR>

<p>The
Q-matrix is the same size as the rewards <span class=GramE>matrix</span> but
all cells are initialized with zeros. For n many iterations, the model will
randomly select a state, a point on the map represented by a row on the rewards
matrix, then move to another state and calculate the rewards for that action.
For example, say the model picks point 2 as a state, it can go to either points
1, 3 or 4. According to the rewards matrix, the bot is on row 2 (third from
top) and the only cells that aren’t -1s are 1, 3 and 4. Point 4 is chosen at
random. According to the Q-Learning algorithm, the score for this move is the
current point, plus gamma times maximum value of the new action points:</p>
<BR>

<BR>
<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="img/image006.png" width='50%' height='50%' alt="Image">
<BR>
</p>
<p>That
move is valued at 100 points and entered into the Q-matrix. Why 100? Gamma
multiplied by max(<span class=GramE>Q[</span>(4,2),(4,4)]) equals zero as the
bot hasn’t visited those rooms yet and our Q-matrix still only holds zeros.
Because as that is the value in <span class=GramE>R[</span>2,4] and. Had the
model chosen <span class=GramE>point</span> 3 instead, then:</p>
<BR>

<BR>
<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="img/image007.png" width='50%' height='50%' alt="Image">
</p>
<BR>

<p>After
running the model for few hundred iterations, the model converges and returns
the following matrix:</p>
<BR>

<BR>
<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="img/image008.png" width='50%' height='50%' alt="Image">
<BR>
Figure 4: Q-Matrix with converged scores from
learning&nbsp;process.</p>
<BR>

<p>The
matrix shows that starting from point 0 (row 0/room 0), the next step with the
highest score is room 1 at 215.14 points. Moving down to the second row, room 3
has the highest score at 268.93 points. Finally, dropping to the third row,
room 4 has the highest score, at 336.16 points, which is the goal point. But
you can also pick any point you want and find the best path to the goal point
from that vantage point (for example starting from room/point 3).</p>
<BR>

<p>Let’s
get back to our factory incident. We had to take this detour as the matrices
for our factory are just too big to display and hopefully will be easier to
understand. We now let the bot run loose over the factory floor.</p>

Setting up Q-Learning at a high level
" Rewards Table: Create the rewards table based on a map and the starting and goal points desired.
" Q Table: Initialize the Q-Learning matrix using same dimensions as the rewards matrix and set all cells to 0.
" Discount Factor: Choose a gamma score between 0 and 1, somewhere in the middle so that it doesn't always go for the immediate reward. We set it to 0.8 in this example.
" Iterations: Determine the number of trips to run. This is based on the size of the map (larger maps will require more iterations). We selected 3000 iterations for our factory floor and the corresponding GitHub code uses an early breakout function to stop iterating once it finds the ideal path.
Q-Learning in action
1.  Select a random starting state (a random room in the factory).
2.  Select a random next action from the available next actions.
3.  Calculate maximum Q value for next state (Q[state, action] = R[state, action] + gamma * max(Q[nextState,]) and update the Q-matrix.
4.  Set next state as current state.
5.  Keep iterating unless the early-stop function confirms optimal path or runs out of iterations.



<p>Figure 5: Shows the optimized path and reward points to go from the factory entrance to the chemical's leak.</p>

<p>Once
the model runs through its iterations, the model <span class=GramE>converges</span>
and the Q values stabilize.</p>

Figure 6: Shows the Q scores for the optimal path from the
factory entrance to the chemical&nbsp;leak.</p>
<BR>

<p>The
Q-Learning model is outfitted with an early-stop feature that will compare the
optimal path to the latest Q scores. If the Q scores confirm the optimal path
for at least 10 iterations, the model ends automatically. This allows setting
large iterations values without being forced to run through them all.</p>

<p>The
model successfully converges, finds the optimal path from the entrance of the
factory to the goal point, i.e. the chemical leak. The early-stop mechanism
stops the model around 2700 iterations.</p>

<p><H1>Part 2:
Analysis of Environmental Data: Using Enhanced Q-Learning with Case-based
reasoning (CBR)</H1></p>
<br><br>

<p>Now,
let’s learn from past data to improve on shortest path to chemical leak. After
the robot finds the leak, any additional recorded data can be downloaded and
analyzed in order to learn what happened and what were the conditions
surrounding the leak beyond humidity readings. The hope is to glean information
to help the robot get to the leak faster the next time around.</p>
<BR>

<p>You
could easily analyze that data with a linear-regression model to find patterns
using paths, time, or distance against the additional collected features.</p>
<BR>

<p>In
this hypothetical story, after analyzing the data, a correlation emerges
between temperature and proximity to the leak</span><span style='font-size:

style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Georgia",serif;mso-fareast-font-family:
"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";letter-spacing:-.05pt'>the
closer the bot got to the leak, the hotter it got. The thicker blue lines
represent a 1-degree temperature jump, the yellow, a 2-degree jump and red, a
5-degree jump.</p>
<BR>

<BR>
Figure 8: Temperature differentials on the factory
floor — red for hot, yellow for warm and blue for&nbsp;tepid.</p>
<BR>

<p>Even
though this data didn’t help the first emergency scenario or speed up the bot’s
iteration process to find the shortest path to the leak, it could prove useful
in future similar scenarios. The bot can use the temperature information to
spend more time on some routes and ignore others.</p>
<BR>

<p>We
create a similar factory map with the same story of a chemical leak but this
time with an understanding of the leak/temperature relationship. The closer we
get to the leak, the hotter it should get. We fire off the bot using an
enhanced Q-Learning algorithm using the principles behind Case-based reasoning
(CBR). The software needs to account for historical similarities with previous
cases and use any additional hints it has gleaned in the past to help new
searches. In this current situation, it will favor steps with increasing
temperatures versus steps with decreasing or non-changing ones. There are a few
ways of approaching this in Q-Learning. We could change the rewards map
directly to account for this ‘enhanced’ reward data or simply encourage the bot
to take routes with increasing temperatures whenever faced with multiple path
choices, in this case, we go with the latter. Whenever the bot has to choose
between multiple routes, we give more weight to any with rising temperature.</p>

<BR>
Figure 9: The RL bot took less than 1800 tries to confirm
the ideal path from the factory entrance to the leak with&nbsp;CBR.</p>
<BR>

<p>You
may need to run both examples a couple of times in order to see this pattern
emerge. Overall, it takes the CBR-enhanced model almost 1000-less iterations to
find the ideal path over the original scenario. This is a toy problem but the
ramifications of using RL to map areas along with the ability of recording
additional data are real. Even though the immediate use of this additional data
may not be apparent, with a little post-processing, it could open up additional
and incredible possibilities. This is like unsupervised learning where we don’t
quite know what we’re going to get but we want it regardless. In this day of
Internet of Things (IoT), it is best to record all available information on the
suspicion that it may be useful in the future</span><span style='font-size:
