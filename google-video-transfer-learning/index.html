<p>The above celebrity pipeline can chew through a celebrity video faster than you can say protagonist - and that’s the whole point!</p>

<p>Can we divert some of that speed and instight towards something other than finding celebrities? What if we wanted to identify regular people? Or any other entity not currently offered with Google Video Intelligence?</p>

<p>Yes, we can!</p>

<p>All we need to do is swap one step in the pipeline (albeit with some manual pre-processing work required). We remove the image web-search step and replace it with our own trained convolutional deep neural network. If you are trying to find family members on a video, then a web search using headshots probably won't help you (unless you're kids are super famous).</p>

<H2>Inception V3, Transfer Learning, And A Massive Modeling Shortcut</H2>
<BR>
<p>Inception V3 is the third inception version of convolutional deep neural networks (CNN) trained to recognize general object categories using the famous ImageNet dataset.</p>
<BR>
<blockquote>“The ImageNet project is a large visual database designed for use in visual object recognition software research. Over 14 million URLs of images have been hand-annotated by ImageNet to indicate what objects are pictured; in at least one million of the images, bounding boxes are also provided. ImageNet contains over 20 thousand ambiguous categories; a typical category, such as "balloon" or "strawberry", contains several hundred images.” 
<p style="text-align:right">
<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ImageNet' target='_blank'>Wikipedia Imagenet</a></p></blockquote>
<BR>
<p>Inception V3 can differentiate between 1,000 different objects (<a href='http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2014/browse-synsets' target='_blank'>image-net.org</a>):

<BR><BR> 
<p style="text-align:center">

</p>
<p style="text-align:right">(<a href='https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/inception/README.md' target='_blank'>Inception in TensorFlow</a>)</p>
  
<BR><BR>
<p>Transfer learning is a big deal in supervised CNN modeling. Simply put, you can ask a model already trained on a set of object to recognize different ones. As you may know, large models require a lot of data and huge processing power with specialized hardware. Having the ability of piggy backing powerful and publicly-available models is a huge time saver!</p>

<blockquote>“Transfer learning or inductive transfer is a research problem in machine learning that focuses on storing knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem. For example, knowledge gained while learning to recognize cars could apply when trying to recognize trucks.” 
<p style="text-align:right">
<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning' target='_blank'>Wikipedia Transfer Learnin</a></p>
</blockquote> 

<p>If its the first time you hear about this, you may wonder how a model that has only been trained to recognize mundane things like cars, fruits, trees, etc. can also be used to differentiate between my children.</p>

<p>The best way to convince yourself is to try it out. It turns out that this approach does a good job with new data and new labels spliced right at the end of the network. But the main takeawy is that it would take efforts in the multiples with big hardware, a whole lot more data and serious hyperparameter-tuning knowledge to do this from scratch.</p>

<H2>Getting Started</H2>
<BR>
<p>You need to install <a href='https://www.tensorflow.org/install/index' target='_blank'>TensorFlow</a> or pip install it on your machine:

<pre class="r"><code>pip install tensorflow</code></pre>

<p>You’ll also need to copy the <a href='https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/image_retraining/retrain.py' target='_blank'>retrain.py</a> script (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/image_retraining/retrain.py) to you local machine. </p>
<BR>
<H3>You Don't Need That Much Training Data</H3> 
<p>The approach of the "retrain.py" script is very clever. It does most of the heavy lifting for you. All you need to do is collect training data and place each category in its own folder. I want to analyze footage and be able to recognize if either of my kids is in a picture. So all I need to do is create a “kids_photos” folder underneath the "tf_file" folder and another set underneath that, one-per-category (i.e. one for kid1 and another for kid2 if you are modeling for two groups).</p>

<p>I collected about 40 headshots for each of my two kids and applied <a href='https://keras.io/preprocessing/image/' target='_blank'>Keras ImageDataGenerator</a> to generate thousands of additional versions of each with slight random alterations.</p>

<BR><BR> 
<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="img/image-data-generator.png" alt="Keras ImageDataGenerator output" style='padding:1px; border:1px solid #021a40; width: 50%; height: 50%'>
</p>
<BR><BR> 
<p>Your folder structure should look like the following:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>retrain.py
tf_file
| - kids_photos
    | - kid1 
        | - _0_1.jpg
        | - _0_2.jpg
        | - _0_3.jpg
    …
    | - kid2
        | -  _0_1.jpg
        | -  _0_2.jpg
        | -  _0_3.jpg
    …
</code></pre>
<BR>
<p>If your folder does look like the above, you are ready to transfer learn. You simply need to call the below retrain.py script in a terminal window with the following parameters. </p>
<BR>
<H3>Transfer Learning</H3>
<BR>
<p>This is the incredible part, all you need to get a new model using your own data and labels, is to run the following code:</p>
<BR>
<pre class="r"><code>python ./retrain.py 
--bottleneck_dir=./tf_files/bottlenecks 
--how_many_training_steps 5000 
--learning_rate 0.01 
--train_batch_size 10 
--model_dir=./tf_files/inception 
--output_graph=./tf_files/retrained_graph.pb 
--output_labels=./tf_files/retrained_labels.txt 
--image_dir ./tf_files/kids_photos</code></pre>
<BR><BR> 
<p>The first run takes time as it downloads inception and builds the bottleneck files (analysis of spliced images). As it models the new data, it spits out training messages just like any model does. It will return an accuracy score for training and validtion. You may need to run the model a couple of times (it runs a lot faster the second time around) and play around with parameters like “learning rate”, “train batch size”, and “how many training steps”.</p>

<p>In this example, the model did learn nicely in both training and validation:</p>

<pre class="r"><code>
2018-03-30 05:39:06.357276: Step 4999: Train accuracy = 100.0%
2018-03-30 05:39:06.357435: Step 4999: Cross entropy = 0.005487
2018-03-30 05:39:06.422331: Step 4999: Validation accuracy = 99.0% (N=100)
Final test accuracy = 98.3% (N=709)
</code></pre>
<BR><BR> 
<p>Once you think the model can differentiate between categories within an acceptable level of accuracy, you are done. </p>
<BR><BR> 
<H3>Predicting On Live Data</H3>
<BR>
Obviously, the whole point of the model is to run it on the output of our celebrity-finding engine but you can also run one-offs to see how your trained model works on a single image (from <a href='https://kiosk-dot-codelabs-site.appspot.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/#0' target='_blank'>tensorflow-for-poets</a>):

</code></pre>
