<p>First part out of 3, word2vec on Tensorflow and modeling the Enron Email Dataset. We'll clean up the emails, model it with word2vec skip-gram and cluster it to discover themes.</p>

<H2>
Welcome to Part 1: Applying word2vec on the Enron data set
</H2>
<p><BR></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec" target="_blank">word2vec</a> probably doesn’t need an introduction as its been around for a few years and is extremely popular in the NLP community. In a nutshell, it is a straightforward single layer neural net through which you feed large bodies of text and it will model complex word relationships. For more information on the model, check out one of the original papers: <a href="http://web2.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/seminar/2016_discrete_data/readings/MikolovSutskeverChenCorradoDean2013.pdf" target="_blank">Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and their Compositionality</a>.</p>

word2vec Tutorial for Tensorflow
</H3>
<p>For information on word2vec’s Tensorflow tutorial, please visit: <a href="Vector Representations of Words" target="_blank">Vector Representations of Words</a>, meanwhile, go the the GitHub repo to copy and run the code <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.1/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/word2vec/word2vec_basic.py" target="_blank">word2vec_basic.py</a> (this assumes you have Tensorflow up-and-running).</p>
<p>Here is the final logged loss along with the top word distances.</p>

<p>Some word relationships are good, like <b>‘can: may, would, could, will, should, must, might, cannot’</b>, others not so much. This is using the <a href="http://mattmahoney.net/dc/textdata" target="_blank">Text8 corpus</a>, let’s try it with the Enron Email dataset.</p>
{% include follow-me.html %}￼
<H2>
Enron Corpus
</H2>
<p>“The Enron Corpus is a large database of over 600,000 emails generated by 158 employees[1] of the Enron Corporation and acquired by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission during its investigation after the company’s collapse.” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_Corpus" target="_blank">Source: Wikipedia</a></p>
<p>This dataset is quite interesting as it is one of the few large and unscrubbed email corpus available in the public domain. There are various places you can download the dataset. I went with <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/enron-email-dataset" target="_blank">Kaggle.com: The Enron Email Dataset</a> as it not only has the dataset but plenty of kernels showing you how to explore, analyse and transform the data.</p>
<p>Here is the full source code to use the Enron dataset instead of Text8, be sure to update the <code>ENRON_EMAIL_DATASET_PATH</code> using the path wherever you downloaded the data.</p>

<p>And now let’s cluster these word-embedded vectors so we can understand some of the over-arching themes contained in this dataset:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#########################################################
# Check out some clusters
#########################################################

# create a dataframe using the embedded vectors and attach the key word as row header
import pandas as pd
enrond_dataframe = pd.DataFrame(final_embeddings)
enrond_dataframe = enrond_dataframe.set_index([ reverse_dictionary.values()])
 
# See what it learns and look at clusters to pull out major themes in the data
CLUSTER_SIZE = 300 
# cluster vector and investigate top groups
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=CLUSTER_SIZE)
cluster_make = kmeans.fit_predict(enrond_dataframe)

labels = kmeans.predict(enrond_dataframe)
import collections
cluster_frequency = collections.Counter(labels)
print(cluster_frequency)
cluster_frequency.most_common()

clusters = {}
n = 0
for item in labels:
    if item in clusters:
        clusters[item].append(list(enrond_dataframe.index)[n])
    else:
        clusters[item] = [list(enrond_dataframe.index)[n]]
    n +=1

for k,v in cluster_frequency.most_common(100):
  print('\n\n')
  print('Cluster:', k)
  print (' '.join(clusters[k]))</code></pre>
<p>I was not overwhelmed by the resulting clusters eventhough we can see beginnings of themes. This is undoubtedly because the Enron email corpus just isn’t big enough for word2vec. You could definitely use tweak the word2vec and even use the Continuous Bag-of-Words model (CBOW) model. In the next video, we’ll use pre-trained vector embeddings and you will be surprised by the clarity a large and complex word-vector embedding understanding makes!!</p>
