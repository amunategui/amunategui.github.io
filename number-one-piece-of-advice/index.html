<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Whenever I am asked how to break into this field, I reply, ‘push it out into the public domain on a regular basis’.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Being a blogger and liking the sound of my voice, I unfortunately murk it up with more stuff, like taking classes on Udacity and Coursera, participating in competitions on Kaggle, and getting a degree in data science. But, at the top of the list, will always be, create, invent and push out regularly!</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">It may go against the grain within some organizations, so don’t share trade secrets or other people’s IP; but there’s always something within your skillset that others will find interesting.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">It’s a miracle technique! It’s isn’t about quantity or quality but about doing it on a regular basis and building that production muscle</span><span class="s4"> </span><span class="s1">—</span><span class="s4"> </span><span class="s1">it becomes magic! It will take you to unexpected places.<b> </b>Kind of like compounding interest or butter in your coffee</span><span class="s4"> </span><span class="s1">—</span><span class="s4"> </span><span class="s1">there’s no downside to this approach!</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">You will learn to express yourself better, write better, and put yourself out there. You will gain a fuller grasp of the topics discussed</span><span class="s4"> </span><span class="s1">—</span><span class="s4"> </span><span class="s1">there is nothing like explaining it to others to learn it better yourself.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"><b></b></span><br></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1"><b>Great For Finding Jobs And Networking</b></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">You will be sending the clear message that you enjoy this stuff and spend time on it. That you are motivated, entrepreneurial, and you know your stuff</span><span class="s4"> </span><span class="s1">—</span><span class="s4"> </span><span class="s1">what kind of employer or customer could resist that? You will meet a lot of people, not just students but a wide range of professionals as well. You will be invited to speak at conferences and meet ups.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1"><b>Great For Your Current Job</b></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">These may be stories for another entry, but I have connected with colleagues within a large health system through my You Tubes, I kid you not</span><span class="s4"> </span><span class="s1">—</span><span class="s4"> </span><span class="s1">people I would email directly and never get a reply</span><span class="s4"> </span><span class="s1">—</span><span class="s4"> </span><span class="s1">sometimes a social media knock is louder than an office door knock.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"><b></b></span><br></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1"><b>You become Accountable</b></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">You become part of the educational and research community, you become part of the internet, it becomes you!</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"><b></b></span><br></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1"><b>And I Eat My Dog Food</b></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">I am a believer and follower</span><span class="s4"> </span><span class="s1">—</span><span class="s4"> </span><span class="s1">I started pushing code and blog entries actively In 201</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">And 4 years later, barely halfway through 2018, I’m still pushing stuff!</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">So don’t worry too much about what you’re writing about, worry more about doing it on a regular basis. If you like working on projects, push out on GitHub, if you write articles, try Medium, or Reddit, if you like to give professional advice, try LinkedIn. Roll your own, do it on WordPress or GitHub.io. If you are a live type, try podcasts and YouTubes, mix and match, do multiples, or do them all!</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Push!</span></p>
